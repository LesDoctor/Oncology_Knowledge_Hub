Small volume bone marrow involvement may be missed with both FDG PET-CT and mIBG SPECT-CT: bone marrow biopsy needed. FDG PET-CT may be a better predictor of PFS than mIBG.13 123I-mIBG still gold standard after chemotherapy (FDG PET-CT less sensitive and specific for bone/bone marrow disease). mIBG positive neuroblastomas can become mIBG negative; problem-solving role of FDG PET-CT in these cases. [18F]F-fluorophenyl-alanine (F-DOPA) and [68Ga]Ga-somatostatin receptor (SSR) analogues are alternative PET tracers, not widely available yet, with higher sensitivity compared to FDG PET-CT and 123I-mIBG SPECT-CT. [18F]F-meta-fluorobenzylguanidine (MFBG) new promising tracer.","• Clinical justification outlining the role of FDG PET-CT in mIBG negative neuroblastoma  
• Documentation of previous imaging results (mIBG and any other relevant scans)  
• Summary of the patient's treatment history and current status  
• Any relevant pathology reports supporting the need for imaging due to soft tissue lesions or bone marrow involvement"
